Ingredients

    1/2 lb beef (cut for stew)
    2 onions
    2 carrots
    3 potatoes
    1 Tbsp oil
    3 1/2 cups water (840ml) or see the package for the amount of water
    1 box curry sauce mix (4 oz)
    ---Optional Seasonings---
    1 Tbsp ketchup
    1 Tbsp Worcester sauce
    1 Tbsp apricot jam
    1 Tbsp soy sauce
    1 tsp curry powder
    Steamed Rice
Instructions

    1. Cut vegetables into bite size pieces.
    2. Heat oil and brown meat in a pot, then take meat out.
    3. In the same pot, fry onions for 8 minutes. Add carrots and potatoes, then cooked meat.
    4. Add water to the pot. After it boils, skim fat, and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes until the meat becomes tender.
    5. Remove from heat and add curry sauce mix. Stir well so the pieces of the mix dissolve.
    6. If you'd like to use the optional seasonings above, now add the ketchup, worcester sauce, apricot jam, and soy sauce. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes (cook longer if you'd like it thicker).
    7. If you'd like to add the optional curry powder, stir it in just before serving.
    8. Pour the curry over rice.
